# Emulation Techniques

[? Back to Domain Concepts](README.md)

## What is CPU Emulation?
CPU emulation is the process of simulating the behavior of a physical CPU in software. This allows running legacy software, testing, or building virtual machines.

## Approaches to Emulation
- **Interpretation**: Each instruction is fetched, decoded, and executed in a loop (used by Zem80)
- **Dynamic Recompilation**: Blocks of instructions are translated to host code for speed (not used in Zem80)
- **Cycle-accurate Emulation**: Simulates timing at the level of CPU clock cycles (Zem80 aims for this)

## Challenges
- Accurate timing (t-states, wait states)
- Correct handling of undocumented instructions
- IO and interrupt emulation
- Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs

## Zem80's Approach
- Written in idiomatic C# for clarity and maintainability
- Modular design: separate classes for CPU, memory, IO, timing, and instructions
- Focus on correctness and extensibility

## Example: Main Emulation Loop
```csharp
while (cpu.Running) {
    // Fetch, decode, execute
}
```
